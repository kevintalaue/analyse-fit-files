# fit-files
This is my first repo on github, this will be my practice repo on learning how to use github with a personal project reading and parsing fit files 
My name is Kevin Talaue
I am a automotive and heavy truck technician
I specialize in performing data driven diagnostics and repairs on automotive and heavy truck vehicles
Taking what I know from automotive and heavy truck I joined Preteckt to perform diagnostics and prognotics
While at the same time learning on how to become a data scientist
This is the next step in my journey
